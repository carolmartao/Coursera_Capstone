The city sits in a shallow basin with low mountains to the west. It lies about 220 miles (350 km) southwest of Rio de Janeiro and about 30 miles (50 km) inland from its Atlantic Ocean port of Santos. By the end of the 20th century, the city of São Paulo proper had a population of more than 10 million, and the metropolitan region had soared to about 19 million inhabitants. Area city, 576 square miles (1,493 square km)[1]. \n","\n","As a work force of this city, I decided to choose São Paulo in my project. The city is divided into many Boroughts, I selected the most famous districts, 74 in total. São Paulo has a high population density. Crowded cities tends to receive a lot of shops and social areas. When we think of it by the workforce point of view, we expect them to prefer the districts where there is a lower rental cost and, at the same time, they may want to choose the district according to the social places density (venues) and also prefer locations as close to the city center as possible. \n","\n","When considering all these variables, we can create a map and charts in order to find where the Rental index is placed and how each Borough is clustered according to the venue density.\n","\n","\n","This project uses some data science powers to generate a few most promissing boroughs based on these criterias above. Advantages of some areas will will be clearly expressed. Best possible final location can be chosen by workers!\n"],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"source":["## 1.2.

The .csv file has coordinates of all cities from Brazil. First, I cleaned the data and reducted it to data only from São Paulo city [2]; \n","* Venues data were obtained from Foursquare API, to explore restaurants, hotels, stores, their type and location in every borough [3];\n","* It's challengeful to find public data related to demographic and social parameters for the city of São Paulo. Sometimes,you must set-up your own data tables in most cases. In this case, I collected latest House Rental Prices Averages for each Borough of São Paulo from housing retail web pages.\n","* It was considered a standard apartment for rental, as it follows: until 1-2 bedrooms, 1 garage, 70 m2.
